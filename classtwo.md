**Choosing a text editor**
Text editors are programs that allow you to edit text.  While the goal (editing text) is always the same, different text editors do different things, and which one to use is often based on personal preference.  Some editors feature word completion or code completion.  Some will automatically close bracketed text.  Some will only work for certain operating systems and some come with certain operating systems.  It's best to explore and find which one suits you best.


**The command line**
The command line (or terminal) is where commands (keystrokes) entered with the keyboard are presented in text.  A full line of commands will be preceded by a prompt, which will appear again after the commands are executed.  Executing a command is when the computer carries out whatever action you typed it to do.


**Basic navigation**
There are some very specific commands used to navigate though the system (Computer).  The first one to know is pwd, which stands for print working directory.  This will show you where you are currently located in your system.  The command ls, which stands for "list", will show you what is contained in your current location.  Using brackets around text makes the command optional****
Using -l with ls makes it a long listing.
Using /etc displays the contents of a file rather than the name.
Paths display the root location of your file all the way to the location it's contained in, with each location seperated by forward slashes (/).  A "." can be used in place of your current directory (location)   a ".." can be used in place of the preceeding or "parent" directory.

**About files**
Everything inside linux is a file.  It does not use extensons for file names but rather looks inside the file to determine what it is.  Linux is case sensitive and spaces are used to seperate items.  To put a space in a single item it must have a backslash (\) before the space.  Also anything in "" is considered a single item.  "hidden" files are designated with a . preceeding the file name.  hidden files can be shown in a list by adding -a after ls.
